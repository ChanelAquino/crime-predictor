## Introduction / Objective
In this project, we will utilize, visualize, and analyze data from the [Crime Data from 2010 to Present](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-Present/y8tr-7khq) dataset. The dataset reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2010. Before any preprocessing, there are approximately 1.73 million rows and 26 columns in the dataset; each row represents a crime incident.  

After some initial data observation, we will finally create some classification learning models to predict what crime will be committed given certain predictors.

## Data 
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(maptree)
library(caret)
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grbruns/cst383/master/lin-regr-util.R")
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grbruns/cst383/master/class-util.R")
#crimes = read.csv('~/crime-predictor/crimes.csv', na.strings=c('NA', 'N/A', '<NA>'))
crimes <- read.csv('crimes.csv',na.strings=c('NA', 'N/A', '<NA>'))
names(crimes) = tolower(names(crimes))
```

## Preprocessing / Cleaning
The following is a table of columns that were removed from the dataset and the reasons why they were removed.  

column removed      | description of column                 | reason for removing
------------------  | ------------------------------------- | -----------------------
dr.number           | the division records number           | merely uniquely IDs each row; does not provide valuable information
area.id             | ID of community police station        | will use __area.name__ column for area 
reporting.district  | 4-digit code that represents a sub-area within a Geographic Area | will use __location__ column for locating crimes
mo.code             | modus operandi: activities associated with the suspect in commission of the crime | would be time consuming to translate these to their descriptions
crime.code          | indicates the crime committed         | will use __crime.code.description__ to describe crime committed
crime.code.1        | same as crime.code                    | (same as above)
crime.code.2        | code for any additional crime         | crime codes 2, 3, and 4 are respectively less serious offenses
crime.code.3        | code for any additional crime         | (same as above)
crime.code.4        | code for any additional crime         | (same as above)
premise.code        | code for the type of structure, vehicle, or location where the crime took place | will use __premise.description__ to describe premise
weapon.used.code    | code for the type of weapon used      | will use __weapon.description__ to describe weapon
status.code         | status of the case                    | status of the case irrelevant to predicting crime committed
status.description  | defines the status code provided      | (same as above)
address             | street address of crime incident rounded to the nearest hundred block to maintain anonymity | will use __location__ column for locating crimes
cross.street        | cross street of rounded address       | (same as above)
```{r}
crimes[['dr.number']] = NULL
crimes[['area.id']] = NULL
crimes[['reporting.district']] = NULL
crimes[['mo.codes']] = NULL
crimes[['crime.code']] = NULL
crimes[['crime.code.1']] = NULL
crimes[['crime.code.2']] = NULL
crimes[['crime.code.3']] = NULL
crimes[['crime.code.4']] = NULL
crimes[['premise.code']] = NULL
crimes[['weapon.used.code']] = NULL
crimes[['status.code']] = NULL
crimes[['status.description']] = NULL
crimes[['address']] = NULL
crimes[['cross.street']] = NULL
```

## Missing Data
After removing unneeded columns, we calculated the percentages of NA values in each column in the dataset. (If there are no NA values in the column, this information was not displayed.) 8% of the rows in the dataset did not have values for the __victim.age__ column. These rows were omitted from the dataset.
```{r}
pct.na = apply(crimes, 2, function(x) round(mean(is.na(x)) * 100, 3))
pct.na = pct.na[pct.na > 0] 
data.frame(pct.na)
crimes = na.omit(crimes)
```

## Preprocessing (continued): month, day, year, and hour
Here, __month__, __day__, __year__, and __hour__ columns were created after being derived from the __date.occurred__ and __time.occurred__ columns. These new columns represent the date and time that the crime occurred. Finally, crimes that occurred during the years 2010 - 2013 (inclusive) will be removed from the dataset, resulting in a dataset with crimes occurring in the past 5 years only.
```{r}
crimes$month = as.numeric(substr(crimes$date.occurred,1,2))
crimes$day = as.numeric(substr(crimes$date.occurred,4,5))
crimes$year = as.numeric(substr(crimes$date.occurred,7,10))
years = c(2014:2018)
crimes = crimes[crimes$year %in% years,]

crimes$hour = NA
rows = which(nchar(crimes$time.occurred) == 1)
crimes$hour[rows] = 0

rows = which(nchar(crimes$time.occurred) == 2)
crimes$hour[rows] = 0

rows = which(nchar(crimes$time.occurred) == 3)
crimes$hour[rows] = as.numeric(substr(crimes$time.occurred[rows],1,1))

rows = which(nchar(crimes$time.occurred) == 4)
crimes$hour[rows] = as.numeric(substr(crimes$time.occurred[rows],1,2))

crimes[['date.reported']] = NULL
crimes[['date.occurred']] = NULL
crimes[['time.occurred']] = NULL
```

## Preprocessing (continued): Categorizing crime.code.description, weapon.code.description, and victim.descent
Currently, there are 143 unique values in the __crime.code.description__. In an effort to simplify classification, values in this column will be categorized into 1 of 4 groups: i) violent crime, ii) property crime, iii) consensual crime, and iv) other (which contains white-collar crimes, organized crimes, and consensual crimes. Descriptions and examples of these different types of crime can be found in the online text, [Social Problems: Continuity and Change](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_social-problems-continuity-and-change/s11-02-types-of-crime.html). It is important to note that we lose some valuable information when condensing 143 crime descriptions into 4 categories.
```{r}
crimes$crime.code.description = tolower(crimes$crime.code.description)
crimes$crime.type = NA

# violent crime
patterns = c('assault', 'neglect', 'firearms', 'rape', 'sex', 'abuse', 
             'shots', 'bomb', 'kidnap', 'lynch', 'battery', 'reckless driving',
             'abandonement', 'drugs', 'manslaughter', 'trafficking', 'abortion',
             'weapon', 'cruelty', 'child', 'false imprisonment', 'threats', 'chld',
             'homicide', 'oral copulation', 'incest', 'firearms restraining order' )
crimes$crime.type[grepl(paste(patterns, collapse = "|"), crimes$crime.code.description)] = "violent"

# property crime
patterns = c('burglary', 'theft', 'shoplifting', 'stolen', 'arson', 
             'vandalism', 'defrauding innkeeper', 'disrupt school',
             'pickpocket', 'train wrecking', 'robbery', 'theft of identity',
             'tresspassing', 'document forgery / stolen felony', 'rob', 'prowler',
             'stalking', 'peeping tom', 'unauthorized computer access',
             'disturbing the peace', 'failure to disperse', 'fraud',
             'throwing object at moving vehicle', 'property', 'snatching', 'till tap')
crimes$crime.type[grepl(paste(patterns, collapse = "|"), crimes$crime.code.description)] = "property"


# consensual crime
patterns = c('pimping', 'resisting', 'indecent exposure', 'contempt of court',
             'violation of temporary restraining order', 'failure to yield',
             'violation of restraining order', 'driving without owner consent', 'document worthless',
             'bribery', 'pandering', 'extortion', 'counterfeit')
crimes$crime.type[grepl(paste(patterns, collapse = "|"), crimes$crime.code.description)] = "consensual"

# other crime
crimes$crime.type[is.na(crimes$crime.type)] = "other"

crimes$crime.type = factor(crimes$crime.type)
crimes[['crime.code.description']] = NULL
```

Similary, the 79 unique values in the __weapon.description__ column were used to create a new column, __weapon.type__ that contains 1 of 4 values: i) projectile, ii) edged, iii) impact, and iv) other (which includes chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction). Details on these types of weapons can be found on the [Black Belt](https://blackbeltmag.com/martial-arts-weapons/5-categories-of-modern-weapons-how-to-incorporate-them-into-your-reality-based-self-defense-training/) website. Again, it is important to note that we lose some valuable information when condensing 79 weapon descriptions into 4 categories.
```{r}
crimes$weapon.description = tolower(crimes$weapon.description)
crimes$weapon.type = NA

# projectile weapons
patterns = c('bottle', 'pistol', 'gun', 'revolver', 'rifle',
             'bow and arrow', 'semiautomatic assault', 'firearm',
             'rock', 'thrown')
crimes$weapon.type[grepl(paste(patterns, collapse = "|"), crimes$weapon.description)] = "projectile"

# edged weapons
patterns = c('knife', 'screwdriver', 'switchblade', 'cutting', 
             'dagger', 'razor', 'glass', 'ice pick', 'machete',
             'sword', 'cleaver', 'scissors', 'axe')
crimes$weapon.type[grepl(paste(patterns, collapse = "|"), crimes$weapon.description)] = "edged"

# impact weapons
patterns = c('belt flailing instrument/chain', 'hammer', 'club/bat', 
             'martial arts weapons', 'brass knuckles', 'syringe', 'rope', 
             'strong-arm', 'stick', 'pipe', 'board', 'fixed object',
             'concrete block', 'tire iron', 'blackjack')
crimes$weapon.type[grepl(paste(patterns, collapse = "|"), crimes$weapon.description)] = "impact"

# other weapons
crimes$weapon.type[is.na(crimes$weapon.type)] = "other"

crimes$weapon.type = factor(crimes$weapon.type)
crimes[['weapon.description']] = NULL
```

Finally, the __victim.descent__ column was altered to contain the following values: asian, black, hispanic/latin, american indian/native, pacific islander, white, other/unknown. The __victim.sex__ column was also altered to contain the following values: male, female, and other/unknown.
```{r}
crimes$victim.descent = tolower(crimes$victim.descent)
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'a'] = 'asian'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'c'] = 'asian'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'd'] = 'asian'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'f'] = 'asian'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'j'] = 'asian'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'k'] = 'asian'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'l'] = 'asian'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'v'] = 'asian'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'z'] = 'asian'

crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'b'] = 'black'

crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'h'] = 'hispanic/latin'

crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'i'] = 'american indian/native'

crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'g'] = 'pacific islander'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'p'] = 'pacific islander'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 's'] = 'pacific islander'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'u'] = 'pacific islander'

crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'w'] = 'white'

crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'o'] = 'other/unknown'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == ''] = 'other/unknown'
crimes$victim.descent[crimes$victim.descent == 'x'] = 'other/unknown'

crimes$victim.descent = factor(crimes$victim.descent)

crimes$victim.sex = tolower(crimes$victim.sex)
crimes$victim.sex[crimes$victim.sex == 'm'] = 'male'
crimes$victim.sex[crimes$victim.sex == 'f'] = 'female'
crimes$victim.sex[crimes$victim.sex == 'x'] = 'other/unknown'
crimes$victim.sex[crimes$victim.sex == 'h'] = 'other/unknown'
crimes$victim.sex[crimes$victim.sex == ''] = 'other/unknown'
crimes$victim.sex = factor(crimes$victim.sex)
```

## Data Exploration
The boxplot below shows the age distribution of victims by their descent. For instance, victims of American Indian/Native descent were, on average, about 24-25 years old. Victims of Asian descent were, on average, about 40 years old.
```{r}
par(mar=c(10,5,5,5))
boxplot(victim.age ~ victim.descent, data=crimes, main='victim ages and descent', las=2, ylab='age', col='red')
```

The barplot belows shows the frequency distribution of crimes committed by the hour. Less crimes were committed during the hours between 4 and 5 (i.e., 4am and 5am). It is interesting to note the visual anomaly at hour 12 (i.e., 12pm), when most crimes were commited.
```{r}
barplot(table(crimes$hour), main='hour crime committed', xlab='hour', col='red', las=1)
```

As previously noted the hour of the day were most crimes occur.  The following barplot will depict the total number of crimes commited for the number day of the month.
```{r}
barplot(table(crimes$month), main="Day out of the month crime commited", xlab="Day",col="firebrick")
```
As shown from the barplot, it is interesting to see that the total number of crimes are about the same for each day of the month.  It is also important to notice the anomaly for the first day of each month.  The total number of crimes on the first occur one fourth additional times than the rest of days.  It is also interesting to note that the least ammount of crimes happen on the 31st.  Which makes sense for not all months have 31 days.


The quadruple density plot below further breaks down crimes by the hour, by the type of crime it was. Overall, the plots below follow the same pattern as the barplot above. Again, we see a significant increase in crimes committed during the afternoon. The plot for property crimes shows a very interesting pattern than noticeably fluctuates in between the hours of about 13 and 22 (i.e., 1pm and 10pm).
```{r}
# quadruple density plot for hour
plot(density(crimes$hour[crimes$crime.type == 'property']), main='density plots for crime hour', col='green', xlab='hour')
grid()
lines(density(crimes$hour[crimes$crime.type == 'violent']), col='red')
lines(density(crimes$hour[crimes$crime.type == 'other']), col='orange')
lines(density(crimes$hour[crimes$crime.type == 'consensual']), col='blue')
legend('topleft', fill=c('green', 'red', 'orange', 'blue'), legend=c('property', 'violent', 'other', 'consensual'))
```


###Victim sex based on crime type
The following plot will depict which sex is more susceptible to the different types of crimes.
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
par(mar=c(3,4,3,.5))
plot(crimes$victim.sex[crimes$crime.type == "property"], main="Property Crime Type", col="firebrick",ylab="Number of Crimes")
plot(crimes$victim.sex[crimes$crime.type == "violent"], main="Violent Crime Type",col="firebrick",ylab="Number of Crimes")
plot(crimes$victim.sex[crimes$crime.type == "consensual"],main="Consensual Crime Type",col="firebrick",ylab="Number of Crimes")
plot(crimes$victim.sex[crimes$crime.type == "other"], main="Other Crime Type",col="firebrick",ylab="Number of Crimes")
```

From the graphs, it is evident to see that for property crimes, males were afflicted the most.  But for the the rest of the different crime types, women were afflicted the most. Which in overall, women are more susceptible to most crimes compared to the other sexes.

## Classification Tree Model 
```{r}
# TODO: dario + assessment
set.seed(132)
crimes.small = crimes[crimes$year %in% c(2016,2017),]
tr.rows = sample(1:nrow(crimes), .75*nrow(crimes))
tr_dat = crimes[tr.rows,]
te_dat = crimes[-tr.rows,]

treeFit = rpart(crime.type ~  month + victim.sex+ victim.age + weapon.type  ,data=tr_dat, method="class")

prp(treeFit, extra=104, varlen=-10,
 main="Classification for Crime Type",
 box.col=c("palegreen", "pink")[treeFit$frame$yval])
```

As we can see from the model above, the classification tree is only displaying two nodes.  From the information obtained from the fit, it was evident that the most important variable type was weapon.type(99) and the second most important variable was victim.age(1).  Which is why on the classification tree weapon.type is the only visible predictor shown.


From the confusion matrix, it is evident that there was no prediction made for consensual and other.
```{r}
predicted = predict(treeFit, te_dat, type="class")
actuals = te_dat$crime.type
conf = table(predicted, actuals)
conf
```

It can also be noted that the accuracy of our model is about 82%, which is quite good.
```{r}
 x =table(as.data.frame(predicted))
 succ_rate = mean(predicted == actuals)
 round(succ_rate, 3)
```

From the values obtained from the predictions obtained from the tree classification, it was interesting to notice the total number of crimes for each category.

```{r}
y = as.data.frame(predicted)
options(scipen=5)
plot(y, main="Number of Crimes Predicted for Each Category from Decision Tree", xlab="Crime",ylab="Number of Ocurrences", col="firebrick")
```

As noted from the plot above, it was interesting to see that the there were no predictions made for 'consensual' and 'other'.  There is about 150k 'violent' crimes, but it is outstanding to see that for 'property' the total number of crimes is almost 400k.


Another interesting to note is the purity of node from the classification tree.
```{r}
# compute Gini index for a node (factor of 2 not used)
gini_index = function(v) {
  tbl = table(v)
  probs = tbl/sum(tbl)
  terms = sapply(probs, function(p) p * (1 - p))
  return(sum(terms))
}
node = crimes[,c("crime.type","victim.age","victim.sex","weapon.type")]
node.purity = gini_index(node$crime.type)
node.purity
```

From the classification tree, using month, victim.sex, victim.age, weapon.type as predictors, it is predicted that the crime type is Property.

```{r}
table(crimes$crime.type)/nrow(crimes)
```

When comparing the training results, it can be seen that the probablity of property is bigger than the rest. Which correlates to the predictions from classification which predicted crime type to be property.

## Naive Bayes Classification Model 1

For this first model, we decided to use area.name and weapon.type to predict the crime.type . Even though our classification tree model had a good acuracy, wanted to see if using Naive Baye's algorithm would improve our results. 

## Splitting Data
Below, training and testing sets are created, where the training set is composed of 75% of the original dataset.
```{r}
set.seed(123)
tr.rows = sample(1:nrow(crimes), .75*nrow(crimes))
tr.dat = crimes[tr.rows,]
te.dat = crimes[-tr.rows,]
```


##Creating Model and Generating Predictions
```{r}
library(e1071)
# TODO: evert + assessment

#Creating model
nb.fit1 = naiveBayes(crime.type ~ area.name + weapon.type, data=tr.dat, type='raw')

#Predictions & Accuracy
predicted = predict(nb.fit1, te.dat)
actual = te.dat$crime.type
paste("acurracy:",mean(predicted == actual))
table(actual, predicted)

```
 
Here we have our first Naive Baye's model and the predicitons it generated on our test data.

###Frequency of type.crime in test data and predictions
```{r}
barplot(table(tr.dat$crime.type),col = "red4", main="Frequency of type.crime in training data",ylab="Number of incidents")


barplot(table(te.dat$crime.type),col = "red4", main="Frequency of type.crime in test data",ylab="Number of incidents")


plot(predicted,col = "red4", main="Frequency of type.crime in model",ylab="Number of incidents")

```

These graphs help us understand our model a little bit better.  Since the majority of the types of crime commited fall into either the "violent" class or the "property" class in our traning data, it seems like our model is only predicting from these two classes. Despite this, it is still achiving a decent accuracy.  A learning curve was produced to see if our modle had high variance or bias.
 

###Learning Curve for NB Model 1
```{r warning=FALSE}
te_errs = c()
tr_errs = c()
te_actual = te_dat$crime.type
tr_sizes = seq(0.4,0.9, by = 0.1)

for (tr_size in tr_sizes) {
  tr_rows=sample(1:nrow(crimes),tr_size*nrow(crimes))
  tr_dat=crimes[tr_rows,]
  te_dat=crimes[-tr_rows,]
  tr_actual = tr_dat$crime.type
  nb.fit1.lc = naiveBayes(crime.type ~ area.name + weapon.type, data=tr_dat, type='raw')
  
  
  # error on training set
   tr_predicted = predict(nb.fit1.lc, newdata=te_dat, type="class")
   err = mean(tr_actual != tr_predicted)
   tr_errs = c(tr_errs, err)
   
   # error on test set
  te_predicted = predict(nb.fit1.lc, newdata=te_dat, type="class")
  err = mean(te_actual != te_predicted)
  te_errs = c(te_errs, err)
}

#Plot learning curve here
plot(tr_errs~tr_sizes,col="orange",type="b",pch=16,ylim=c(min(tr_errs)-.01,max(te_errs)+0.01),xlab="Training Sizes", ylab="Training Errors",main="Learning Curve for factors area.name and weapon.type")
points(te_errs~tr_sizes,col="blue",type="b",pch=18,ylim=c(min(tr_errs)-.01,max(te_errs)+0.01))
legend("topright",legend=c("training","test"), col=c("orange","blue"),pch=c(16,18))

```

After analyzing several learning curves on our model, we generally see that traning error and testing error are quite similar and consistent, with testing error decreasing slightly at the end.  By the shape of the graph, we can also see that our model has some bias.  To fix this issue we can me more careful about the predictors that we use.


## Naive Bayes Classification Model 2: victim.descent, and victim.age
A second Naive Bayes classification model was created, this time using __victim.descent__ and __victim.age__ to predict __crime.type__. From the apriori of the model, we can see that property crimes were the highest types of crime committed.
```{r}
# TODO: chanel + assessment
nb.fit2 = naiveBayes(crime.type ~ victim.descent + victim.age, data=tr.dat, type='raw')
nb.fit2$apriori
```

The accuracy of this fit is below.
```{r}
predicted = predict(nb.fit2, te.dat)
actual = te.dat$crime.type
mean(predicted == actual)
```

A confusion matrix is below to help give a more detailed perspective of how well this model performed.
```{r}
table(actual, predicted)
```

Below are mean and standard deviation values for victim ages categorized by the crime type.
```{r}
nb.age.info = nb.fit2$tables$victim.age
nb.age.info
```

### Feature Distribution for NB Model 2
Using the tables provided in the fit, we can show the feature distributions below.  

The first pair of graphs show the density distribution of victims' ages both from the training dataset (right) and as estimates from the Naive Bayes fit (left).
```{r}
# density plot for victim.age, from naive bayes
x = crimes$victim.age
y.property = dnorm(x, mean=nb.age.info['property',1], sd=nb.age.info['property',2])
y.violent = dnorm(x, mean=nb.age.info['violent',1], sd=nb.age.info['violent',2])
y.other = dnorm(x, mean=nb.age.info['other',1], sd=nb.age.info['other',2])
y.consensual = dnorm(x, mean=nb.age.info['consensual',1], sd=nb.age.info['consensual',2])

plot(x, y.violent, main='NB estimate of age distribution', col='red', xlab='victim age')
grid()
par(new=T)
plot(x, y.property, col='green', main='NB estimate of age distribution', xlab='victim age', xaxt='n')
par(new=T)
plot(x, y.other, col='orange', main='NB estimate of age distribution', xlab='victim age', xaxt='n')
par(new=T)
plot(x, y.consensual, col='blue', main='NB estimate of age distribution', xlab='victim age', xaxt='n')

# quadruple density plot for victim.age, from training dataset
plot(density(crimes$victim.age[crimes$crime.type == 'property']), main='density plots for victim age, from training data', col='green', xlab='victim age')
grid()
lines(density(crimes$victim.age[crimes$crime.type == 'violent']), col='red')
lines(density(crimes$victim.age[crimes$crime.type == 'other']), col='orange')
lines(density(crimes$victim.age[crimes$crime.type == 'consensual']), col='blue')
legend('topright', fill=c('green', 'red', 'orange', 'blue'), legend=c('property', 'violent', 'other', 'consensual'))
```


Before performing a similar process for victim descent, we first graphed a quadruple density plot that helps visualize victims' descent by the type of crime that was committed. We can see that for people of African/African American (i.e., 'black'), Hispanic/Latin, or 'white' descent were victims for mostly some type of violent crime, while people of Asian or other/unknown descent were victims for some type of property crime. Another interesting observation is that people of Pacific Islander or American Indian/Native descent experienced virtually no crimes compared to victims of other descents. (As we don't know the population demographic for the city of LA, this should be taken with a grain of salt.)
```{r}
# quadruple density plot for victim.descent, from training dataset
par(mar=c(10,5,5,5))
plot(density(as.numeric(crimes$victim.descent[crimes$crime.type == 'violent'])), main='density plots for victim descent', col='red', xlab='', xaxt='n')
grid()
lines(density(as.numeric(crimes$victim.descent[crimes$crime.type == 'consensual'])), col='blue')

Below are probabilities for victim descent categorized by the crime type.
```{r}
nb.descent.info = nb.fit2$tables$victim.descent
nb.descent.info
```

Below is a side-by-side barplot of victim descents, from the training dataset, by the type of crime that was committed. Across the board, we can see that people of Hispanic/Latin descent were the victims of most crimes. People of 'white' descent were the secondmost victims of crimes committed.
```{r}
# side by side barplots for victim descent, frome training dataset
colors = c('bisque2', 'red', 'orange', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'blueviolet')
property = table(crimes$victim.descent[crimes$crime.type == 'property'])
violent = table(crimes$victim.descent[crimes$crime.type == 'violent'])
other = table(crimes$victim.descent[crimes$crime.type == 'other'])
consensual = table(crimes$victim.descent[crimes$crime.type == 'consensual'])
tbls = cbind(property, violent, other, consensual)
barplot(tbls, main='victim descent by crime type, from training data', col=colors, beside=T, las=2)
legend('topright', fill=colors, legend=sort(unique(crimes$victim.descent)), cex=0.55)
```

Finally, the same values as above were estimated using the Naive Bayes classifier. Overall, the same patterns occur, where people of Hispanic/Latin descent were victims of most crimes.
```{r}
# side by side barplots for victim descent, from naive bayes
property = nb.descent.info['property',]
violent = nb.descent.info['violent',]
other = nb.descent.info['other',]
consensual = nb.descent.info['consensual',]
tbls = cbind(property, violent, other, consensual)
barplot(tbls, main='NB estimate of victim descent by crime type', col=colors, beside=T, las=2, ylab='probability')
legend('topleft', fill=colors, legend=sort(unique(crimes$victim.descent)), cex=0.35)
```

## Conclusion

Our goal was to generate a model that would help us predict the type of crime that was committed based on the available data.  Out of the three models that were generated, two of them gave us decent results.  From our first model (classification tree), we learned that weapon type was going to be an important factor in generating a good model.  Our second model (Naive Baye's) also used weapon type as a predictor, but this time it was combined with the area in which the crime was committed.  This model gave us a very similar result to our first model, but we felt that it was a bit more intuitive.  In our last model (Naive Baye's) we were interested to see if the demographics of the victim would be a good predictor for the type of crime that was committed.  Unfortunately, the last model did not perform as well as our previous two models.

From the results of our models, we learned that one of the best predictors for what type of crime is committed, is the type of weapon that was involved.  Before this, we believed that perhaps the demographics of the victim would have been a decent indicator of the type of crimes that are committed, we assumed that perhaps certain demographics would have been more susceptible to be the victims of certain crimes.  It is important to note that this is only true for the City of Los Angeles for crimes committed during this decade.  More data and analysis from other cities would be necessary in order to make any generalizations
